# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

### Local Environment

We maintain a set of docker compose yaml files that allow to run the entire
project with all the dependencies like mongoDb. You can run it
using:

`docker-compose up`

This wrapper scripts supports any command `docker-compose` supports, as it is just a small wrapper to support multiple compose files.
## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
